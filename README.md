# UI client for Ollama

ðŸš€This project is aimed to force me to lear more Rust :)

It's built with usage of [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) + [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

There are no general distribution of ths application.
If you want to use this client, you will need to build it from source ðŸ˜¿

## Run a project

1. You will need Rust (please look for your self, I was doing this readme late night ðŸ¥¹)
2. Tauri

To run in development mode

```bash
yarn tauri dev
```


To build from source

yarn tauri build
```
